# Limit New by Young

Limit New by Young is an add-on for [Anki](https://github.com/ankitects/anki) that can aid in maintaining a stable and efficient daily workload.

Anki already includes settings that can limit both new and reviewed cards by the number of cards that are due for the day, but this kind of limit is not always ideal. If instead you place a limit on the total number of young cards, then you will be fed new cards at roughly the same rate that you learn them. This removes the need to do manually tuning to reach an optimal balance point.

## Setup

To install go to [ankiweb.net](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/214963846) and follow the instructions in the `Download` section.

After installing the add-on you will need to define a limit for one or more decks for the add-on to work. This is done by going to `Tools > Add-ons` selecting this add-on by name then clicking the `Config` button. Follow the instructions on the screen to set the limit value(s) and deck(s) you want. Lastly to apply the limits you can either use the config to enable automatic updates, or manually trigger an update by using `Tools > Recalculate today's new card limit for all decks` from the menu.

To undo the limits you can either set the `New cards/day` limit under `Today only` or switch back to `Preset` found in the deck's options.
